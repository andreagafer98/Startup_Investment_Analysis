# Startup_Investment_Analysis
Business Problem:
It is not an easy task to keep track of the number of startup companies in the
world and even less to find the right startup to invest in. In order to find your next
investment, it is important to know what kind of investor you are to
narrow down your search to a market niche and to understand the numbers around
your investment. This project aims to make this process easier

products/services, ideal locations and amount of money to invest.
